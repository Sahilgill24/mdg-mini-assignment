# mdg-mini-assignment

For the assignment , I have used Click 
I have imported libraries like random and string to make the random password generator 
For tasks related to CLI I used click 
I added 4 options including lenght of password  if we want uppercase , numbers and special characters or not , and created a function , u can either directly input in the command line or answer the y or n questions
